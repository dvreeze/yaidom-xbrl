      <p>
        This specification only provides a textual declaration of syntax
        constraints when those constraints are not expressed by the
        normative schema supplied with this specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explanations of elements and attributes are only supplied when
        explanations are not already provided in other
        specifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless explicitly stated otherwise, a reference to a specific
        element <rfc2119>MUST</rfc2119> be read as a reference to that 
        element or to any element in its 
        <xtermref bibref="XMLSCHEMA-STRUCTURES" idref="key-equivalenceClass">

        The following is the XML schema provided as part of this

        XBRL International, it is the intent (but is not guaranteed)

          non-normative version will reside on the web in the directory
          <code>http://www.xbrl.org/2008/</code> - during the drafting process for
